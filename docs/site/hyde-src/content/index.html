Welcome to sec-wall
===================

**sec-wall** is a feature packed high-performance security proxy supporting
[SSL/TLS](#), [WSSE](#), [HTTP Auth Basic](#)/[Digest](#), extensible authentication
&amp; authorization schemes based on [custom HTTP headers](#) and [XPath](#) expressions, powerful
[URL matching](#)/[rewriting](#) and an optional [headers enrichment](#).
It's a security wall you can conveniently fence the otherwise defenseless backend servers with.

Although best suited for securing middleware and backend application
servers, sec-wall can be used anywhere the ubiquitous HTTP protocol is being used.

sec-wall is open source software, distributed under the terms of a
liberal [GPLv3](http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) license,
it's free for any purpose, including commercial use.

If you're new to sec-wall you may wish to follow the
[Getting started guide](/documentation/getting-started/index.html) which includes downloading the
software, installing it and preparing the first security configuration.

Having understood the basics, you are encouraged to dive into the
[Reference documentation](/documentation/ref-docs/index.html), a set of goal-oriented
[Usage examples](/documentation/usage-examples/index.html) and
[Architecture &amp; design notes](/documentation/arch/index.html).
No question will be left unanswered and all doubts will be resolved.

If you need any help you can pick one of the [commercial][commercial-support]

and an [IRC channel](/support/community.html#irc).

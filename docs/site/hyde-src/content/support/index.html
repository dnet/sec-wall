    <ul>
        <li><a href="mailto:sec-wall-users@lists.launchpad.net">sec-wall-users</a> is an open info-box list anyone
        can join and post their questions or suggestions; note that it's a friendly
        place and absolutely everyone's invited to join and share their thoughts!</li>

        <li><a href="mailto:sec-wall-dev@lists.launchpad.net">sec-wall-dev</a> is
        a place for core developers to join, note that the list is more concerned
        with an ongoing development rather that with direct info-box, for instance,
        if you're not sure where to send your patches, send them in to sec-wall-dev
        but if you're looking for help with configuration, please post it to sec-wall-users,</li>

        <li>IRC - <a href="irc:sec-wall@freenode.net">#sec-wall on Freenode
        network</a> is where the cool kids hang out. It's a perfect place for both quick
        one-off questions and for meeting other users of sec-wall,</li>

        <li>Launchpad infrastructure - if you'd rather not join any mailing lists,
        you can always drop by <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/sec-wall">the bug tracker</a>,
        or the Launchpad's <a href="https://answers.launchpad.net/sec-wall">answer tracker</a>,</li>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="mailto:sec-wall-users@lists.launchpad.net">sec-wall-users</a> is an open support list anyone
        can join and post their questions or suggestions; note that it's a friendly
        place and absolutely everyone's invited to join and share their thoughts!</li>

        <li><a href="mailto:sec-wall-dev@lists.launchpad.net">sec-wall-dev</a> is
        a place for core developers to join, note that the list is more concerned
        with an ongoing development rather that with direct support, for instance,
        if you're not sure where to send your patches, send them in to sec-wall-dev
        but if you're looking for help with configuration, please post it to sec-wall-users,</li>

        <li>IRC - <a href="irc:sec-wall@freenode.net">#sec-wall on Freenode
        network</a> is where the cool kids hang out. It's a perfect place for both quick
        one-off questions and for meeting other users of sec-wall,</li>

        <li>Launchpad infrastructure - if you'd rather not join any mailing lists,
        you can always drop by <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/sec-wall">the bug tracker</a>,
        or the Launchpad's <a href="https://answers.launchpad.net/sec-wall">answer tracker</a>.</li>
    </ul>

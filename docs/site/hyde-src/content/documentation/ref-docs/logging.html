<h1>Logging</h1>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

There are several layers of logging employed by sec-wall. Proper understanding
of all of them is essential for mastering sec-wall yet not all of them will come
in handy in day-to-day work - some of them are rarely needed, for instance, only
when you're to deal with misbehaving proxy instances, others - like the log of
requests passing through a proxy - will be used more frequently.

What gets logged where and why stems directly from
[how sec-wall has been designed](/documentation/arch/index.html)
and the sketch diagram below captures the flow of information that controls the logging process.
Note that all links are relative to
[the config.py file](/documentation/ref-docs/config-file.html).

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

There's [a whole chapter devoted to nothing but showing various examples of sec-wall's configuration files](/ZZZ),
head over there for more information.
